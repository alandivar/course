# For Students Re-taking the Course
Please see the [Stanford CS Honor
Code](https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/ug/HonorCode.shtml). Note that it is considered a form of plagiarism to submit coursework from a previous attempt at the course. You must re-write all your solutions from scratch if you plan on re-taking the course. This applies to both homework assignments and exercise-sets. Please ask the course staff if you have any questions. For students retaking the course, we will hold onto your repositories from the previous year and inspect each of your submissions against the previous year's submission to check for plagiarism against one's own self. It is not sufficient to simply cite that you are copying your previous year's solution; you *must* re-write the code from scratch.
