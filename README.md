# CME212
[Syllabus](https://github.com/cme212/course/blob/master/syllabus.md)

## Final Exam Date
For Winter quarter 2020, the registrar has the 
CME 212 final exam scheduled to take place from 7 P.M. to 10 P.M. 
on Monday March 16th. We will plan to make the exam accessible on Canvas
on Friday March 13th at 7 P.M., giving you a 72 hour window in which you 
can start the exam. However, the exam itself is timed, and once you 
open it you will have three hours to complete it. 
The final exam must be completed on your
own. You may not collaborate on the exam or discuss the exam 
with any Stanford affiliate or anyone outside the institution. The only
resources you may access during the exam are the full set of course notes,
and in addition reference documentation such as
[cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/); you are not allowed to use online search engines to query for information, nor are you allowed to use 
sites such as StackOverflow.
